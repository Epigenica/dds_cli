# Internal use

This repository is for **internal** use: an aligned copy of the SciLifeLab Data Delivery System CLI ([upstream `dds_cli](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/dds_cli)`). Product and API behaviour are documented with **dds_web** (`[dds_web` repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/dds_web), e.g. `[dev/doc](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/dds_web/tree/dev/doc)`). Published upstream CLI docs: [GitHub Pages](https://scilifelabdatacentre.github.io/dds_cli/).

Upstream ships many workflows for lint, tests, security, releases, and docs. On this fork you usually only need **Build fork binaries**. Prefer turning the rest off in GitHub (**Actions** → select a workflow → **⋯** menu → **Disable workflow**) so you stay aligned with upstream files and avoid merge noise; see [Disabling and enabling a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow). Re-disable any new workflow files after merging upstream if you do not need them.

## Default API URL for CI-built binaries

Internal PyInstaller builds use `[.github/workflows/build-binaries-fork.yml](.github/workflows/build-binaries-fork.yml)`. It patches `dds_cli/__init__.py` on the runner before packaging; **nothing is committed**.

**Default:** set `**FORK_DDS_API_BASE_URL`** in the GitHub repo under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** (full API root, including `/api/v1` if that is where your API lives). Used when workflow inputs are empty, including builds triggered by a push to `dev`.

**One-off:** **Actions → Build fork binaries → Run workflow** → fill **api_base_url** with the same value.
